Hi, Iâ€™m a software developer interested in backend development, graphics programming, and Rust/C++.

Here are few hobby projects I've been working on or have worked on

- timeSol | [https://www.timesol.sh](https://www.timesol.sh)
  - A REST API that allows users to query historical data about NFT collections on MagicEden.
